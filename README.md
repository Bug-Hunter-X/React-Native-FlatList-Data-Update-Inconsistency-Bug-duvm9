This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's FlatList component related to data updates and its solution. The bug arises from inconsistent data updates that don't properly handle FlatList's key management, causing visual inconsistencies or crashes.  The solution implements a more robust data update strategy using immutability and proper key assignment to ensure correct rendering and avoid the bug.
